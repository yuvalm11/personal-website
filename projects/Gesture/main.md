# Gesture Controlled Timer

### -- *WORK IN PROGRES* --

I wanted to build an on-device embedded ML vision project. I used the XIAO ESP32-S3 microcontroller and its camera module to detect certain hand gestures to control a timer. I used **Edge Impulse** to train and deploy a TensorFlow Lite (LiteRT) model into the XIAO that runs inference locally.
